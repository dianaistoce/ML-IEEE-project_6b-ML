# Rare Disease Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to improve early diagnosis of rare diseases using machine learning models. It utilizes data from the UK Biobank and Rare Diseases Database to train and evaluate multiple models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (W-KNN).

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- A virtual environment (recommended).

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
